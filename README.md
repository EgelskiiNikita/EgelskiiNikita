Here's *Nikita Egelskii* speaking.
My objectives are prescribed by top values:
- **Motivation**. I want to wake up with fire in my eyes and go to bed thinking about how I will pursue my tasks in the morning.
- **Achievements**. I want to clearly know what I can be proud of and what I have achieved in this life.
- **Commitment**. I want to take on important tasks that affect the lives of the people around me.
- **Independence**. I want to spontaneously break into travel and not depend on the schedule.

Thus, my goal is to find solutions to acute and crucial problems in order to make life easier for myself and society; it will allow me to feel proud of myself and wake up energized every morning.
